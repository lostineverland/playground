    - playing with meander
    - I thought I had my problem solved but the problem lies in the order of execution
    - m/search is a macro, and it expects the full expression to be given as an argument
    - the problem is that macro's run at compile time, so I can't pass a variable because it will not be resolved before the meander algo tries to figure out how to handle it
    - so it's like all my queries are wired (which in reality is always true, but feels wrong)
